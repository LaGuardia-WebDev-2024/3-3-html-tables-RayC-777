                        Other cuts like matambre (a thin cut from between the ribs and skin) 
                        and picaña (rump cap) are good options). This could also include sausages 
                        like chorizo, morcilla. Place them on a grill (parilla) over fiery coal 
                        for a few hours, seasoning with course salt for a charred and savory taste.

                    <td> <b>(LOCK IN THIS IS LOW-KEY LONG)</b> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
 In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the softened butter, egg, vanilla, and 
 lemon zest (if using). Mix with your hands or a fork until the dough just comes together. Do not overwork the dough. 
 Cut the quince paste into cubes and place in a saucepan with 2 to 3 tablespoons of water. Stir over low heat until it 
 melts into a smooth, spreadable jam. If using dulce de leche, microwave it for 20 seconds to make it easier to spread.
Reserve about one-quarter of the dough for the lattice top. Press the larger portion of the dough evenly into the bottom 
and up the sides of your prepared tart pan. Pour the warm quince paste or dulce de leche over the dough base and spread 
it evenly with a spatula. Roll out the remaining dough and cut it into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange the strips in a 
lattice pattern over the filling. Press the ends of the strips to the edge of the tart base to seal them. Bake for 25–30 
minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Let the tart cool completely before removing it from the pan. For an extra 
touch, dust with powdered sugar before serving.
